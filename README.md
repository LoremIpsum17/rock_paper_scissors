This is my version of the rock, paper, scissors game. <br>
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. <br> 
The winner is determined according to a set of rules. 
<br>
The Rules are: <br>
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats<br>
Rock beats Scissors <br>
Paper beats Rock <br>
Scissors beats Paper
